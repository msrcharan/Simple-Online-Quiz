# Simple-Online-Quiz

<p>
This Java-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) application is designed to implement an online quiz system. The application provides an interactive quiz environment, where users can answer questions and receive immediate feedback on their performance. The GUI interface is user-friendly and allows users to easily navigate through the quiz questions. The application also includes a simple file management system to store quiz questions and right answers. The quiz questions can be easily added, edited, or deleted from the text files. The application is built using Java's Swing toolkit and uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern for effective separation of concerns. The quiz system is an ideal solution for educational institutions, online courses, and individuals who want to create interactive quizzes.
